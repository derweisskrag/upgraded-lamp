# Test Assignment

## Description

The most important thing to notice: I am implementing the SERVICE. Not a controller, entity; or program, but SERVICE.
It is of great essence to take this fact into account, as I can misinterpret the task and go off on a tangent.

My task is to simulate the slot machine logic (bussiness logic inside the service). It can be `SlotMachine.cs` or `Machine.cs`
- some hierarchy in OOP classes as long as everything is work. 

### Objective

The ultimate goal is to maintain the user session, their balance, history (wins/losses and statistics), as well as to ensure 
that the machine performs accurately and efficiently.


### Solution

Link: [Solution](/src/solution_1/)

Console application. No external programming languagues (C/C++ or Rust integration for performance).

I try to think outside of the box, and not overcomplicate, but make my code modular, abstract, efficient and deliver
the product to target audience. Tools: Rust for random logic, and C# for OOP, Users and State management.

There is a slight chance of the third solution. My goal is to use this current assignment task to sharpen my skills. Hence,
I will test & benchmark both solutions. 

> Integration tests won't be used. Only unittests, exploratory, and parametrized testing. Keeping things simple! I do NOT reinvent the wheel!
